The product aims to assist institutions to maintain a record of all the students(day scholars) entering or leaving the facility. The current system cannot distinguish between day-scholars and hostellers as one must mention their credentials on a register, which canâ€™t be verified. So, to make a verification system we planned to make an application which keeps track of students. It will also connect the students who are availing hostel facility with their respective wardens/concerned authority and allow them to raise enquiries(leave application, complaints etc.). This will make the entire process more transparent and authentic.
